# Welcome

Welcome to the Nemuru API Reference  ðŸ‘‹

The Nemuru platform is an advanced financial software for automating the lending process at the point of sale between Merchants, Borrowers, and Lenders. In other words, Nemuru allows Merchants to offer realtime financing to their clients (Borrowers) through consumer Loans originated on the balance sheet of our lending partners (Lenders) â€” we are a credit intermediator.

### How Nemuru works?

#### Merchant signup

Merchants interested in offering financing to their clients sign up on [Nemuru](https://www.nemuru.com). In order to become users, their documentation is requested, analyzed and validated by Nemuru (offline process). If all checks are passed, Merchants are granted with credentials to log in the Nemuru app.

#### Borrower onboarding

Merchants â€” already admitted by Nemuru â€” can generate and send Loan proposals to their clients from their account. In this stage, Merchants set the initial Loan conditions (Loan amount, term, program) and introduce their client's information.

Their clients (Borrowers) receive a message containing the link to the corresponding onboarding process. They are requested to follow a set of steps to complete their application. These steps include:

- Accepting terms and conditions, GDPR, etc.
- Providing personal info
- Proving identity through video streaming (KYC/AML)
- Granting read access to their bank account (where we capture aggregate data about their consumption patterns)

At this point, our risk engine uses these data to perform comprehensive risk analyses and, in case the result is positive, the lLan application is distributed among our Lenders. If a Lender accepts the application, the Borrower receives the contract and signs digitally, the Loan is generated in the balance sheet of our Lender, and the process finishes. 

#### Merchant backoffice

The Merchant application, also known as Nemuru app, allows Merchants to check the details and status of their operations (Loans), send new Loan proposal to their clients, and access other resources and features.
